## Resources

- Neovim has a steeper learning curve than using a mouse

- Nice to (must ?) read resources :

  - `:help tutor` (30 mins embeded tutorial)

  - `:help` and read the getting started section tutorials

  - http://vimcasts.org

  - http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com

  - https://vimawesome.com

- A not so bad config to start with : https://github.com/paulroseau/nvim-conf
