## Conclusion

#### Literal types can actually be useful

- Allow to move a lot of errors from runtime to compiletime
- Specific and small "fixes" for existing libraries
- Much more... (e.g. generation of json formats from case class)


#### Usage will become more easy

- Scala 3 / Dotty: better syntax and type inference
- Future Shapeless versions: no `Witness` necessary
